                <h3><abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr></h3>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It was originally created by
                    Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> reference implementation is now produced by The <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> Group.
                    <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>: Hypertext Preprocessor.
                    <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> code is usually processed on a web server by a <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common
                    Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> code – which may be
                    any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of a HTTP response. Various
                    web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or
                    facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web
                    context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> code can also be interpreted
                    and executed via command-line interface (CLI). The standard <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free
                    software released under the <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> License. <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost
                    every operating system and platform, free of charge. The <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> language evolved without a written formal specification or
                    standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed
                    to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> specification. As of September 2020, two out of three
                    sites on the web that use <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> are still on discontinued <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> versions, and almost half of all <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> websites use version
                    5.6 or older, that not even Debian supports (while Debian 9 still supports version 7.0 and 7.1, those versions are
                    however already discontinued by The <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> Development Team). In addition, <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> version 7.2, the most popular supported <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>
                    version, will stop getting security updates on November 30, 2020, in less than 2 months, and then unless <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> websites
                    are upgraded to version 7.3 (or newer), 84% of <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> websites will use discontinued versions.

                <h3><abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr></h3>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> (/ˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ (About this soundlisten) S-Q-L, /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel"; Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific
                    language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or
                    for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling
                    structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> offers two main advantages over
                    older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single
                    command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index. Originally
                    based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> consists of many types of statements, which may be
                    informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data
                    control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML). The scope of <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> includes data query, data manipulation
                    (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>
                    is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements. <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> was one of the first commercial
                    languages to utilize Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, "A
                    Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks". Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as
                    described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language. <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> became a standard of the American National
                    Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then
                    the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> code
                    requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.
